Sweet Sixteen
Vinny Vintila

Happy Sweet Sixteen, my dearest teen.
Here she is, already sixteen!
My pretty little girl grew up too fast,
And little girl memories are now in the past.

A hug, a kiss, and a warm embrace
For my little darling with the cutest face!
My little princess is now sixteen,
But in my heart, always my queen!

Love, Dad!
