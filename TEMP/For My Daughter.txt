For My Daughter
by David Ignatow

<div>	When I die choose a star	</div>
<div>	and name it after me		</div>
<div>	that you may know		</div>
<div>	I have not abandoned		</div>
<div>	or forgotten you.		</div>
<div>	You were such a star to me,	</div>
<div>	following you through birth	</div>
<div>	and childhood, my hand		</div>
<div>	in your hand.			</div><br>

<div>	When I die			</div>
<div>	choose a star and name it	</div>
<div>	after me so that I may shine	</div>
<div>	down on you, until you join	</div>
<div>	me in darkness and silence	</div>
<div>	together.			</div><br>
