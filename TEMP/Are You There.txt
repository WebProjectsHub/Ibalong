Are You There?
W H Auden

<div>	Each lover has some theory of his own			</div>
<div>	About the difference between the ache			</div>
<div>	Of being with his love, and being alone:		</div><br>

<div>	Why what, when dreaming, is dear flesh and bone		</div>
<div>	That really stirs the senses, when awake,		</div>
<div>	Appears a simulacrum of his own.			</div><br>

<div>	Narcissus disbelieves in the unknown;			</div>
<div>	He cannot join his image in the lake			</div>
<div>	So long as he assumes he is alone.			</div><br>

<div>	The child, the waterfall, the fire, the stone,		</div>
<div>	Are always up to mischief, though, and take		</div>
<div>	The universe for granted as their own.			</div><br>

<div>	The elderly, like Proust, are always prone		</div>
<div>	To think of love as a subjective fake;			</div>
<div>	The more they love, the more they feel alone.		</div><br>

<div>	Whatever view we hold, it must be shown			</div>
<div>	Why every lover has a wish to make			</div>
<div>	Some kind of otherness his own:				</div>
<div>	Perhaps, in fact, we never are alone.			</div><br>
