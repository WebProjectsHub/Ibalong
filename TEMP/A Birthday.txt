A Birthday
Christina Rossetti

<div>	My heart is like a singing bird			</div>
<div>	Whose nest is in a water’d shoot;		</div>
<div>	My heart is like an apple-tree			</div>
<div>	Whose boughs are bent with thickset fruit;	</div>
<div>	My heart is like a rainbow shell		</div>
<div>	That paddles in a halcyon sea;			</div>
<div>	My heart is gladder than all these		</div>
<div>	Because my love is come to me.			</div><br>

<div>	Raise me a dais of silk and down;		</div>
<div>	Hang it with vair and purple dyes;		</div>
<div>	Carve it in doves and pomegranates,		</div>
<div>	And peacocks with a hundred eyes;		</div>
<div>	Work it in gold and silver grapes,		</div>
<div>	In leaves and silver fleurs-de-lys;		</div>
<div>	Because the birthday of my life			</div>
<div>	Is come, my love is come to me.			</div><br>
