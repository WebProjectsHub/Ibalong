To My Daughter, With Love
Janis Ian

<div>	I'm giving you to the winds, to the earth, to the fire, to the water.	</div>
<div>	I'm giving you to the world, to the future, to the past.		</div>
<div>	I'm giving you to sorrow, to the tears, to the laughter.		</div>
<div>	I'm giving you to the stars, to the moon, to the sun at last.		</div><br>

<div>	I'm giving you to the seasons, to the days, to the hours.		</div>
<div>	I'm giving you to the silence, to the music, to the song.		</div>
<div>	I'm giving you to the questions, to the answers, to the mysteries.	</div>
<div>	I'm giving you to the right, to the wrong.				</div><br>

<div>	I'm giving you to the love, to the pain, to the passion.		</div>
<div>	I'm giving you to the joy, to the struggle, to the grace.		</div>
<div>	I'm giving you to the courage, to the fear, to the longing.		</div>
<div>	I'm giving you to the journey, to the endless space.			</div><br>

<div>	I'm giving you to the whispers, to the dreams, to the memories.		</div>
<div>	I'm giving you to the moments, to the magic, to the chance.		</div>
<div>	I'm giving you to the hope, to the faith, to the wonder.		</div>
<div>	I'm giving you to life, to love, to the dance.				</div><br>

<div>	And in the giving, I find myself, too.					</div>
<div>	For you are my heart, my soul, my everything.				</div>
<div>	And as you spread your wings and take flight,				</div>
<div>	Know that you are loved, eternally, unconditionally.			</div><br>

<div>	To my daughter, with love.						</div><br>
