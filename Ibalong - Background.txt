Ibalong
This fragment manuscript Ibalong was kept by Rev. Fr. Jose Casta単o as a souvenir of his stay in Bicolandia in the 19th century.  It was recounted in verse by a wandering minstrel named Cadugnun; and the priest, due to his diligence, wrote the story down, transcribed the fragment, and then, translated it into Spanish Quatrains.  The Spanish version was published in Madrid by Wenceslao Retana in his archive in 1898.  It is either, that Fr. Casta単o failed to hear the rest of it or failed to write the rest of it.  For this reason, we have very little knowledge about it today.

The events that are narrated in the story happened before, during or immediately after the Deluge.  Of all deluge stories, perhaps, this Bicol narrative is the least satisfactory, because it is the most fragmentary.  It contains only the story of Baltog, the very first man in Bicolandia, and of Handiong, who followed Baltog.  The fragments abruptly end.  There are many gaps in the story and were it not for places named that exist today, one would likely dismiss it as a fragment of Fr. Casta単o's imagination.

Ibalong describes the horrible monsters that the heroes of this narrative dispose of after a terrific battle.  Furthermore, it tells of how the Bicol chiefs taught their people how to make new articles, how to plant, and how to behave according to their rank.  Handiong ruled his people with just laws, taught them many industries, and showed them how to live peacefully and contentedly on the fertile alluvial soil and seas and streams of Aslon and Ibalong.

The setting of the story is Aslon and Ibalong, the region dominated by the mountains Asog, Masaraga, Isarog, and Lingyon (Surprisingly, there is no mention of Mayon in the story).

There is the possibility that Fr. Casta単o and Fray Bernardino de Melendreras, OFM, (Franciscan Order) might have shared an interest in Ibalong.  But by deduction, it could be assumed that Fray Melendreras, OFM, being Franciscan, might have had the first copy of Ibalong given these places mentioned in the epic: Tondo, Cotmon which are found in the municipality of Camalig, Albay; while Lingyon nad Kimantong are within the municipality of Daraga, Albay.  These municipalities were parishes under the jurisdiction of the Franciscan Order since the start of the Spanish domination.
