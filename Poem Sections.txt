Poem Sections:

**Section 1: Introduction and Praise of the Land (Lines 1-24)**
```
Kadugnung, minstrel wise,
Of Handiong's time sing on,
With your famed silver lyre
The sweet land of Aslon,
...
Sing, for attentive all
Your lovely tale are we,
As seated round we list
Beneath this great, shade tree,
```

**Section 2: Description of the Land and Its First Inhabitants (Lines 25-96)**
```
Hear, sons of Bikol, then,
Kadugnung swift replied,
The deeds of this old land,
Handiong's loved countryside.
...
The jawbones measured quite
Or full arm's length they were,
The fangs two-thirds the length
Of handle of his spear.
```

**Section 3: The Conquest of Monsters (Lines 97-216)**
```
Returning to his land,
The jawbones he hung all
On a talisay tree
Near his house in Tondol.
...
But never he subdued
Despite all craft and guile,
The snake sagacious known
By the name of Oriol.
```

**Section 4: The Establishment of Civilization (Lines 217-336)**
```
This snake knew even more
Than famed Handiong could tell,
His eyes did exorcise
And wrought on all a spell.
...
The curious alphabet
Engraved on Libon stone,
Which Surat did continue
Was polished by Gapon.
```

**Section 5: The Natural Disasters and Changes in the Land (Lines 337-432)**
```
A city rose and houses
Of various sizes hung
From the big boughs of the
Banasi, Kamagong.
...
In Bato a big mount
Submerged beneath the ground,
A lake that teems with fish
Now in its place is found.
```

**Section 6: The Final Battle and Conclusion (Lines 433-End)**
```
From Calabanga gulf
Vanished the Dagatnon,
Whence the Dumagats came
Who then lived in Catmon.
...
And here Kadungnung stopped
The first part of his lay,
On some occasion next
To end some other day.
```
Each section represents a different phase in the history and mythology of the land, from its initial praise to the establishment of civilization, and the challenges faced along the way. The poem concludes with the promise of more tales to come.
